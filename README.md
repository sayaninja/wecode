# WeCode
An application that allows for collaborative coding with ease.

## Setup
- Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) (this might be available using your package manager)
- Clone the source code: `git clone https://github.ucsb.edu/CitrixNChill/WeStudy.git`
- Inside the `WeStudy` directory, run `npm install` to install the modules the app uses.
- Create your own branch with git checkout -b "your_branch_name"


## Running
TBD

## Git Branching Model
See [GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html).

Rules:

- **Always** keep the `master` branch in a stable state

- For feature or bugfix work, create a new branch from master with a **descriptive name** of what you are working on,
usually we would want these the same as the PivotalTracker names to give it more consistency. If the PivotalTracker
issue does not make sense, then come up with a descriptive name.

- When you are done and ready to merge your work back to `master`, [open a Pull Request in GitHub](https://github.ucsb.edu/CitrixNChill/WeStudy/pulls)
so others can review your work; add all of the team as reviewers.

  - If you want to open a pull request before you are dont to show others what you have so far, then do so, it can
  can be a constantly updated pull request.
